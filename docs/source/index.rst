Welcome to Wicker's documentation!
==================================

Wicker is a Python framework for storing and serving Machine Learning datasets. It provides:

**Abstraction of underlying storage**

   Read and write data as Python dictionaries - don't worry about where/how it is stored.


**Schematized Data**

   Enforce a schema when reading and writing your data, providing readability and useability for users of your datasets.


**Metadata Indexing**

   Easily store, query and visualize your metadata in your own stores such as BigQuery or Snowflake for downstream analyses.


**Efficient Dataloading**

   Built and optimized for high-throughput distributed training of deep learning models.
